                The Snatch exercise—and its variations—is among the most effective lifts for improving explosive power for athletes. It’s also one of the two lifts that athletes compete in at the Olympics—why it’s called an Olympic lift.
            </p>
            <p>
                What makes the Snatch so effective—and challenging—is the distance the barbell travels in the lift. In a single movement, the bar moves from the floor to over your head—the farthest the bar travels in any exercise. Not only does this require a great amount of strength, you need to move with a high degree of explosiveness to create the speed needed to propel the bar overhead.
